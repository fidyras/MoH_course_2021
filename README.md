Brief description of the course:
This workshop aims to provide participants with experience using R to perform analyses of infectious disease epidemiological data to answer questions relevant to public health policy and decision making. The course will teach participants basic R tools, data visualization techniques and introduction to infectious disease modeling.

Description of the course: 
Through an integrated curriculum that combines data analyses (statistical, management, visualization) with applied public health questions, participants will gain skills to answer applied public health policy and research questions. This course does not require any previous experience in using R or similar statistical software, but does require the participant is actively working on epidemiological research and/or public health by analyzing and visualizing data. The course will be a combination of hands-on activities and lectures. Sessions will include both guided lessons and open office hours to provide time and assistance for individual research or public health projects. Students and practitioners who are already actively involved in research related to these topics are encouraged to participate. See below for eligibility. The course will be taught in French and English but instructors will be available to further explain in Malagasy and/or French when needed.
